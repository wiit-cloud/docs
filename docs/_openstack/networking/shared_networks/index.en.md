# Shared Networks

## Share Network

### If access to both projects is available:

In order to share the network, we need to use the [OpenStackClient](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/), the Project ID into which the network is to be shared, as well as the Network ID of the network to be shared.

The Project ID can be found in the output under "id" if we use the following command:

```bash
openstack project show <Name of Project> -f value -c id
```

Next, we need the Network ID of the network to be shared. We can find this in the output under "id" if the following command is used:

```bash
openstack network show <Name of Network> -f value -c id
```

With the obtained IDs, the network can now be shared into the corresponding project.
To do this, we use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

```bash
openstack network rbac create --type network --action access_as_shared --target-project <ID of Project> <ID of Network to share>
```

## Important information about shared networks

When accessing a shared network, there are limitations that must be considered. One limitation is that no remote security groups can be used.
Additionally, there is no insight into ports and IP addresses from the other project.
Therefore, one can also specify any specific IP addresses for new ports in a subnet (in the shared network), as it would be possible to find IPs that are already in use.

In order to make use of the shared network, there is the option to create a new port. This then receives a random IP address to use, for example, to add a router through this port.
This is not possible in the Horizon dashboard; we need to use the [OpenStackClient](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/).

Please ensure that no spaces or special characters are used in names, as using these can lead to problems.

First, we create the port and specify the shared network there:

```bash
openstack port create --network <ID of shared Networks> <Name of Ports>
```

Now, for example, a router can be created and then mapped to the newly created port:

```bash
##Creation of the router
$ openstack router create <Name of Router>

##Assigning a port to the router
$ openstack router add port <Name of Router> <Name of Port>
```

## Network Topology Project 1

The network "shared" is shared from project 1 to project 2. The service "Example" is available in this network and runs on an instance there.

## Network Topology Project 2

The network "shared" is also visible in project 2 and was attached to the router "router2". In addition, we have the network "network" from which the services in the network "shared" should be accessed.

You have to make sure that the corresponding route is set in the subnet "host route" configuration of the "shared" network in project 1 in order to enable the correct return transport of the packets.

In our example the following route is required: `10.0.1.0/24,10.0.0.1`
