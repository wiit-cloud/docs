Port Forwarding on Floating IPs
==================================

Floating IP port forwarding allows users to forward traffic from a TCP/UDP/other protocol port of a floating IP to a TCP/UDP/other protocol port associated to one of the fixed IPs of a Neutron port.

Create a port forwarding rule on a floating IP
---------------

In order to apply port forwarding on a floating IP, the following information is required:

* The internal IP address to be used
* The UUID of the port to be associated with the floating IP
* The port number of the network port's fixed IPv4 address
* The external port number of the port forwardingâ€™s floating IP address
* The specific protocol to be used in the port forwarding (in this example TCP)
* The floating IP for the port forwarding rule to be applied on.

The example below demonstrates creation of port forwarding on a floating IP, using the required options:

```bash
$ openstack floating ip port forwarding create \
     --internal-ip-address 10.0.0.14 \
     --port 12c29300-0f8a-4c54-a9dc-bee4c12c6ad2 \
     --internal-protocol-port 80 \
     --external-protocol-port 8080 \
     --protocol tcp 185.116.244.141
```

List port forwarding settings applied to floating IPs
---------------

Within a project, a list of port forwarding rules applied to specific floating IPs can be obtained with the following command.

`$ openstack floating ip port forwarding list 185.116.244.141`

The command above can be further refined using `--sort-column` `--port`, `--external-protcol-port` and `--protocol` flags before the floating IP.

Display details of a specific port forwarding rule
---------------

To display the specific details of a Port Forwarding rule for a Floating IP, the following command can be used:

`$ openstack floating ip port forwarding show <floating-ip> <port-forwarding-id>`

Modifying Floating IP Port Forwarding Properties
---------------

If a port forwarding configuration on a floating IP has already been created using `$ openstack floating ip port forwarding create`, further changes can be made to the existing configuration using `$ openstack floating ip port forwarding set ...`.

The following aspects of the port forwarding can be modified:

* `--port`: The UUID of the network port
* `--internal-ip-address`: The fixed internal address associated with the floating IP port forwarding rule.
* `--internal-protocol-port`: The TCP/UDP/etc. port number of the network port fixed IPv4 address associated with the floating IP port forwarding rule
* `--external-protocol-port`: The TCP/UDP/etc. port number of the port forwarding rule's floating IP address
* `--protocol`: The IP protocol used in the floating IP port forwarding rule (TCP/UDP/other)
* `--description`: Text describing/contextualizing the use of the port forwarding configuration

The configuration of any of the above options can be modified with a variation of the following command:

```bash
$ openstack floating ip port forwarding set \
     --port <port> \
     --internal-ip-address <internal-ip-address> \
     --internal-protocol-port <port-number> \
     --external-protocol-port <port-number> \
     --protocol <protocol> \
     --description <description>] \
    <floating-ip> <port-forwarding-id>`
```

Delete port forwarding from a floating IP
---------------

To remove a port forwarding rule from a floating IP, we need the following information:

* The floating IP from which the port forwarding rule is to be removed from.
* The port forwarding ID (This ID is applied upon creation and can be obtained using the `$ openstack floating ip port forwarding list ...` command)

The following command removes the port forwarding rule from a floating ip:

`$ openstack floating ip port forwarding delete <floating-ip> <port-forwarding-id>`
