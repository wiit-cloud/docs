# Enable and Disable Versioning, and Delete a versioned object

## Contents:

Versioning makes it possible to store multiple versions of an object in a bucket.
For example, files named innovo.txt (version 1) and innovo.txt (version 2) can be stored in a single bucket.
Versioning can protect you from the consequences of accidental overwrites or deletion.

## S3cmd

With S3cmd it is not possible to enable versioning or to delete versioned files.

## S3Browser

### Enable versioning

To enable versioning, select a Bucket(1).
Right click on the bucket and then click on "Edit Versioning Settings"(2).

### Disable versioning

Right-click on the bucket and select "Edit Versioning Settings"(2).

### Delete a versioned object

This is not possible in the free version of S3Browser.

## Cyberduck

To see the different versions of a file, hidden files must be displayed.
This option can be found at View(1) → Show hidden files(2)

### Enable versioning

After opening Cyberduck, we select the file on which we wish to activate versioning(1) for.
Then click Action(2) and Info(3).

## Boto3

In Boto3 we first need S3 credentials so that a script can be used. For details see: [Create and use S3 credentials #Boto3](/openstack/storage/s3_documentation/createanduses3credentials/#boto3).

### Enable versioning

To enable the versioning, we will enter the bucket first and then activate the versioning.
One option looks like this:

```bash
## Specifies the bucket in which versioning is to be activated.
bucket = s3.Bucket('iNNOVO-Test')

## Activate versioning
bucket.configure_versioning(True)
```

A complete script for boto 3, including authentication, could look like this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env/python

## Define that boto3 should be used
import boto3
from botocore.client import Config

## Authentication
s3 = boto3.resource('s3',
                        endpoint_url='https://s3.openstack.de-west-01.wiit-cloud.io',
                        aws_access_key_id='aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa',
                        aws_secret_access_key='bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb',
                    )

## Specifies the bucket in which versioning is to be activated.
bucket = s3.Bucket('iNNOVO-Test')

## Activate versioning
bucket.configure_versioning(True)
```

### Disable versioning

As with the activation of versioning, the bucket is needed to deactivate versioning.
One option looks like this:

```bash
## Specifies the bucket in which versioning is to be activated.
bucket = s3.Bucket('iNNOVO-Test')

## Deactivate versioning
bucket.configure_versioning(False)
```

A complete script for boto 3 including authentication could look like this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env/python

## Define that boto3 should be used
import boto3
from botocore.client import Config

## Authentication
s3 = boto3.resource('s3',
                        endpoint_url='https://s3.openstack.de-west-01.wiit-cloud.io',
                        aws_access_key_id='aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa',
                        aws_secret_access_key='bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb',
                    )


## Specifies the bucket in which versioning is to be activated.
bucket = s3.Bucket('iNNOVO-Test')

## Deactivate versioning
bucket.configure_versioning(False)
```

### Delete a versioned object

To delete a versioned object completely, the following command is helpful:

```bash
## Specifies the bucket in which versioning is to be activated.
bucket = s3.Bucket('iNNOVO-Test')

## Delete versioned object
bucket.object_versions.all().delete('innovo.txt')
```
