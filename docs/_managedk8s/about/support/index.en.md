# Support Channels
During the onboarding process, we will choose the suitable communication channel for your organization. The following support channels are available for you to choose from:
### Microsoft Teams
We can create a dedicated support channel within Microsoft Teams for your organization. This channel enables real-time communication with our support engineers, allowing for quick response. It's ideally for organizations that use Microsoft Teams as their primary communication tool.

Availability: During standard business hours.

### Slack
If your organization prefers Slack, we can set up a private Slack channel for direct communication with our support team. This channel provides a space for interactive support, allowing for faster response times and more collaborative problem-solving. It's suited for teams already using Slack for internal communication.

Availability: During standard business hours.
### Email
For formal communication, you can reach our support team via email at mailto:cks.de@wiit.cloud.

Response Time: Typically, you will receive a response during the working hours. The response time may vary depending on the nature and severity of the issue.

### Phone Support
For critical issues that require immediate attention, we provide a oncall support. This is ideal for high-priority incidents that may impact your production environment during the non working hours.

Availability: 24/7 for critical issues, depending on your SLA.

During the onboarding process, we will discuss and agree upon the preferred support channels for your organization. We will also define the service level agreement (SLA) that aligns with your business needs.
