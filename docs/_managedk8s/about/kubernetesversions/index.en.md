## Supported Kubernetes Versions

As part of our Managed Kubernetes service, we ensure that your clusters are always running on supported and stable Kubernetes versions.

To provide clarity on our version support policy, here is an overview of our supported Kubernetes versions, deprecation, and end-of-life (EOL).

| Version | Deprecation | End-of-Life |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| v1.35   | TDB         | TDB         |
| v1.34   | TDB         | TDB         |
| v1.33   | TDB         | TDB         |
| v1.32   | 2026-02-25  | 2026-05-31  |
| v1.31   | 2025-11-18  | 2026-02-01  |
| v1.30   | 2025-09-01  | 2025-12-01  |

## Force Upgrade Policy

If a customer cluster is not updated by its owner until the announced End-of-Life date, it will be automatically upgraded to the next supported version.

You can read more about the deprecation and force upgrade policy [here](../../clusterlifecycle/deprecationpolicy).
