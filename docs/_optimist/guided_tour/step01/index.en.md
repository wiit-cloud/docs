# Step 1: The Horizon (Dashboard)

## Start

In this step-by-step tutorial, you will learn how to use OpenStack.

You will start with the Horizon dashboard, then switch to the
console and finish with writing your own Heat
template.

## Login

After you have received your credentials, you can log on to the
dashboard.

**IMPORTANT**: You cannot automatically reset the password. If you
need a new password, write an e-mail to <support@gec.io>

The URL for the dashboard is
<https://optimist.gec.io>
