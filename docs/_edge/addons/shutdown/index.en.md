# Shutdown API

## Overview

The Shutdown API allows for a controlled shutdown of the edge environment in emergency situations (e.g., power outages). This process is automated, while the startup must be performed manually by our team.

**Important**: Please notify us after initiating a shutdown and provide the estimated recovery time.

All API endpoints require an authentication token, which can be obtained via our helpdesk.

## Shutdown process

When triggered, the Shutdown API performs the following steps:

* Sends a stop signal to all OpenStack virtual machines.
* Stops the storage layer.
* Powers down the hosts.

## Usage

Base URL: `https://shutdown.<EDGE>.wiit-edge.services/`

## Simulation

Use the simulation endpoint to test your integration without performing an actual shutdown. It connects to OpenStack, hosts, and BMC to simulate the process as closely as possibleâ€”without stopping any services.

**Note**: A new simulation can only be started once the current shutdown process is complete (`running: false` in status output).

### Trigger Simulation

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'auth-token: <TOKEN>' https://shutdown.<EDGE>.wiit-edge.services/simulate
```

Response:

```json
{"data":"We've got your request","error":null,"status":"success"}
```

The status of the shutdown process can be retrieved via status endpoint (see below).

### Check Status

```bash
curl -X GET -H 'auth-token: <TOKEN>' https://shutdown.<EDGE>.wiit-edge.services/simulate/status
```

Response Example:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "running": false,
        "start_time": "2025-06-24T07:47:04.065478",
        "current_step": "Description of the current step (only included while the shutdown process is running)",
        "error": "Last Error. Only included if an error happened during the last shutdown."
    },
    "error": null,
    "status": "success"
}
```

## Shutdown

Use this endpoint only when a real shutdown is required.

### Trigger Shutdown

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'auth-token: <TOKEN>' https://shutdown.<EDGE>.wiit-edge.services/shutdown
```

### Check Shutdown Status

```bash
curl -X GET -H 'auth-token: <TOKEN>' https://shutdown.<EDGE>.wiit-edge.services/shutdown/status
```
